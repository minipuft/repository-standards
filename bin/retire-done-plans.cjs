/**
 * Retires finished plans at release time, sorting them out of the working set.
 *
 * The queue is the frontmatter, not a separate list: `status: done` IS the tag meaning
 * "retire at the next release". The convention it reads — four fields, the status vocabulary,
 * and the done/reference test below — is defined at:
 *
 *   https://github.com/minipuft/repository-standards/blob/main/conventions/plan-frontmatter.md
 *
 * This repository owns the portable mechanism and contract. Each consumer's release guide still
 * owns when it runs, which sources it scans, and whether a release workflow invokes it.
 *
 * WHY A PLAN LEAVES THE WORKING SET, and why that is not just "it is finished":
 *
 *   done      → executed to completion, nothing points at it → plans/archive/ (gitignored;
 *               git history is the archive, which is why a plan must be COMMITTED before it
 *               is retired — archiving an untracked file destroys it)
 *   reference → finished, but something still points at it (an ADR, a successor plan, a doc)
 *               → plans/reference/ (tracked, because its citers need it to resolve)
 *
 * Both are finished work. Neither belongs beside `active` and `backlog` plans, which is what
 * this script exists to prevent — but they leave by different doors, because an inbound link
 * makes a plan load-bearing for a document that outlives it. Archiving one would break that
 * document, which is why `--check` fails on a `done` plan that has an inbound link: that plan
 * is misclassified and belongs at `reference`, not in the archive.
 *
 * That is the whole gate. It does NOT fail merely because the queue is non-empty — `done`
 * plans exist legitimately between releases, and a check that fired on their existence
 * would be red almost always and therefore ignored.
 *
 * Usage (run from a consuming repository):
 *   retire-done-plans                 # check: report the queue, fail on misclassification
 *   retire-done-plans --apply         # move done → archive/, reference → reference/
 *   retire-done-plans --self-test
 *   retire-done-plans --repo /path/to/consumer
