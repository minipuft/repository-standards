/**
 * Runs, locally, every gating check the `PR Conventions` workflow runs on an authored PR.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The repo's stated contract is that "CI is the contract; every other gate is a
 * documented strict subset of it" (CLAUDE.md §Validation Gates). For the PR boundary that was
 * false in the one direction that costs a CI cycle: `CONTRIBUTING.md` documented exactly ONE of
 * its gating steps — the body check — so a contributor who followed it to the letter still
 * opened a PR with an unchecked title. Measured twice:
 *
 *   · 2026-09-14 (#283) — `validate-pr-body.mjs --body-file … --title …` passed locally and CI
 *     failed on `subject-case`. The squash-merge subject IS the PR title, so commitlint judges it;
 *     this script's header says outright that it "does not read the title beyond its type".
 *   · 2026-09-16 (#312) — a body composed by hand instead of generated passed its author's own
 *     review and CI reported three missing sections and a 488-word fold.
 *
 * Neither is a discipline failure that more prose fixes. The correct local path was four commands
 * across two directories while the incorrect one (`gh pr create --body "…"`) was a single command,
 * and no npm script named the gate — every other gate in this repo has one (`validate:all`,
 * `lint:ratchet`, `verify:mcp`). This is that name.
 *
 * WHAT IT GUARANTEES. `MIRRORED_CI_STEPS` below names each workflow step it stands in for, and
 * a parity test in the consumer repo, where one exists, reads the workflow file and fails when
 * the two sets diverge. So a fifth gating step added to CI breaks this script's test until it is
 * mirrored here — the subset relation is enforced rather than asserted in a comment.
 *
 * Every step RUNS; none short-circuits. A body failure and a title failure are independent
 * defects, and reporting only the first costs a second round trip to find the second.
 *
 * NOT ZERO-DEPENDENCY, unlike its two siblings in this directory, and that is safe: commitlint is
 * a root devDependency and this script is never the pre-install CI path. `validate-pr-body.mjs`
 * and `pr-body.mjs` keep their zero-dependency posture because the workflow runs them before
 * `npm ci`; this one runs only on a developer machine with the tree installed.
 *
 * Usage (from the repo root):
 *   npm run pr:body -- --out /tmp/pr-body.md     # seed it; do not author one from scratch
 *   $EDITOR /tmp/pr-body.md
 *   npm run pr:check -- --body-file /tmp/pr-body.md --title "feat(scope): outcome"
 *   node scripts/pr-check.mjs --self-test        # positive control: both halves can fail

 * whose `run:` also carries an `npm ci` that has no local counterpart.
 *
 * `needsAuthoredInput` marks the two steps that judge THIS pull request rather than the checkout.
 * They are the ones that need a body and a title, and the ones the self-test drives.
